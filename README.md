# Streamlabs Sub Goal - Minecraft Hearts

Custom Streamlabs sub goal bar that displays as a filling set of minecraft hearts where the hearts change and rank up after being completely filled.

The bar has a configurable number of heart containers, number of subs per heart, tiers, etc. Currently only goes up to 8 tiers but more could be added easily if you're a bit css savvy.

If all 8 tiers are used at 1 sub per heart and 10 heart containers it would take 800 or 880 subs to fill the heart depending on the "Rank Up Rollover Point" set in the bar Custom Fields.
